INSTRUCTIONS
-- Config is auto created if it doesn't already exist --
use the config to adjust outbound IP. 8.8.8.8 is default and is google. 
pingsToDisplay will change the number of pings the program displays in the prompt. this number also factors into the avgerage
highPingThreshold, should it survive, will log any pings over that amount into a subfolder called "Logs"
run the program and it'll start

DETAILS:
router highPingThreshold is hard set by routerObj = pingTester.interface(gatewayGrabber.routerTester().localIP, pingsToDisplay, 20)
the 20 at the end means anything higher than 20 ping is logged.
